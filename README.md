# Horiseon Website- Code Refractor

This is the website for "Horiseon", a fictional company that specializes in helping clients improve their online presence by using search engine optimization, along with various other related strategies (reputation management, social media marketing, etc.).

I refractored the existiing code of this website for a project as part of the MSU full-stack coding bootcamp.
